ConstructKoin (CTK) is designed as a presale for ReFi infrastructure, not a speculative memetoken. Key features that create asymmetric upside potential: These design choices increase the conditional convexity: upside is larger than a random presale because hitting milestones materially de-risks the project for bigger buyers. Regulatory complexity, partner execution failures, and unreliable oracle attestations are real risks. Investors should judge CTK by verifiable milestones — not price chatter. BTC and ETH supply the runway; high-convexity bets like CTK can take off only when execution and compliance convert interest into institutional capital. ConstructKoin’s phased presale and compliance-first architecture create a conditional pathway to higher convexity — but it’s a results-driven play. If CTK proves pilots and secures lender commitments, the presale could outperform standard L1 exposure in percentage terms. Until then, it remains a strategic, higher-risk allocation for diversified portfolios.

        "content": "Bitcoin ETF inflows are rebounding modestly in 2025, led by BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust with $28.1 billion in net additions, signaling cautious institutional adoption amid Bitcoin’s price stability near $113,000. Bitcoin ETFs see daily inflows of $202.48 million, pushing total assets under management to $154.81 billion. BlackRock dominates with strong investor preference for its efficient structure over legacy funds. Grayscale’s GBTC faces ongoing outflows of $24.62 billion since 2024, highlighting shifts in market dynamics with 26.9 billion total ETF inflows this year. Discover how Bitcoin ETF inflows are surging under BlackRock’s lead in 2025, boosting institutional confidence. Explore key trends and implications for crypto investors today. What Are Driving Bitcoin ETF Inflows in 2025? Bitcoin ETF inflows are experiencing a gradual resurgence driven by renewed institutional interest and Bitcoin’s price recovery above $107,000. Data from Glassnode indicates that spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted modest daily inflows of less than 1,000 BTC, a fraction of the 2,500 BTC seen in previous bull markets, yet signaling steady demand. This cautious momentum underscores Bitcoin’s evolving role as a stable portfolio asset rather than a high-risk speculation. Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. are starting to pick up again after a quiet stretch, showing that investors are slowly regaining confidence. Data from Glassnode shows Bitcoin’s recent price rebound from $107,000 came right as money started flowing back into spot ETFs. Bitcoin ETFs are slowly regaining strength as inflows rise again, but demand still trails far behind past bull cycles. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust dominates the market, driving nearly all ETF inflows and shaping investor confidence. Grayscale’s GBTC continues to bleed funds, showing investors prefer more efficient and trusted Bitcoin ETF options. Still, the inflows are small—less than 1,000 BTC a day—compared to the 2,500 BTC seen during past major rallies. This means interest is returning, but the excitement hasn’t fully come back yet. Source: Glassnode The renewed ETF activity reflects ongoing institutional interest, though investors seem more selective this cycle. Data from SoSoValue shows Bitcoin ETFs recorded a $202.48 million daily net inflow, pushing total managed assets to around $154.81 billion. During the same period, Bitcoin traded near $113,689, maintaining relative price stability despite brief fluctuations. Hence, capital continues to flow steadily into Bitcoin ETFs, reinforcing the view that institutions now see Bitcoin as a core investment asset rather than a speculative trade. Source: Sosovalue How Is BlackRock Leading Bitcoin ETF Inflows? BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has emerged as the undisputed frontrunner in the Bitcoin ETF space, capturing the bulk of investor capital with its robust infrastructure and regulatory compliance. According to Vetle Lunde, Head of Research at K33, Bitcoin ETFs have attracted $26.9 billion in net inflows this year, with IBIT alone accounting for $28.1 billion—effectively propping up the entire sector. This leadership is evident in recent data, where IBIT’s daily inflows significantly outpaced competitors, reflecting strong trust from both retail and institutional investors who prioritize low fees and high liquidity. Without BlackRock’s contribution, aggregate ETF inflows would dip into negative territory, underscoring the firm’s pivotal role in sustaining market momentum. Lunde further notes that this concentration of flows highlights a maturing market where established players like BlackRock benefit from their scale and reputation. Meanwhile, the overall assets under management for Bitcoin ETFs have climbed to $154.81 billion, a testament to the growing acceptance of cryptocurrency within traditional finance portfolios. Source: Vetle Lunde In contrast, Grayscale’s GBTC continues to struggle. The fund has not recorded a single month of positive flows since its January 2024 conversion. GBTC has lost about $24.62 billion in cumulative outflows, severely weighing on the sector’s overall performance. Moreover, analysts note that removing both IBIT and GBTC from aggregate figures would leave the ETF market slightly positive, though not significantly. This dynamic illustrates a clear bifurcation: innovative, cost-effective products like IBIT are drawing capital away from higher-fee alternatives, fostering a more competitive and efficient ecosystem. Industry observers, including those from the Financial Times, emphasize that such trends could accelerate Bitcoin’s integration into mainstream investment strategies, with projections for continued growth as regulatory clarity improves. Beyond BlackRock, other major players like Fidelity and ARK Invest have seen sporadic inflows, but none match the consistency of IBIT. For instance, Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund recorded smaller net additions, aligning with broader patterns of selective investing. This selectivity is informed by Bitcoin’s historical volatility, now tempered by ETF accessibility, which allows investors to gain exposure without direct custody risks. Experts like those at Bloomberg Intelligence predict that as Bitcoin stabilizes around current levels, inflows could accelerate, potentially reaching new highs by year-end. Frequently Asked Questions What Factors Are Influencing Current Bitcoin ETF Inflows? Current Bitcoin ETF inflows are influenced by Bitcoin’s price stability near $113,000, institutional demand for diversified assets, and confidence in regulated products like spot ETFs. Data from SoSoValue highlights $202.48 million in daily nets, driven by low-fee options that appeal to long-term holders seeking exposure without direct crypto ownership. Why Is BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Outperforming Competitors? BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust outperforms due to its massive scale, competitive fees, and strong brand trust among investors. As Vetle Lunde from K33 explains, IBIT has single-handedly driven $28.1 billion in inflows this year, far surpassing rivals amid a market where efficiency and liquidity are paramount for institutional participation. Key Takeaways Modest Rebound in Inflows : Bitcoin ETFs are seeing daily nets of $202.48 million, indicating renewed but cautious investor interest following price recoveries. BlackRock’s Dominance : IBIT leads with $28.1 billion in additions, highlighting the importance of trusted, low-cost structures in attracting capital. Grayscale Challenges : GBTC’s $24.62 billion outflows since 2024 underscore the need for innovation to retain investor flows in a competitive landscape. Conclusion In summary, Bitcoin ETF inflows are regaining traction in 2025, propelled by BlackRock’s leadership and steady institutional adoption, even as challenges like Grayscale’s outflows persist. This shift toward efficient vehicles reinforces Bitcoin’s status as a viable asset class. As market dynamics evolve, investors should monitor regulatory developments and price trends for opportunities to engage with this growing sector.",

While it’s slightly below the recent three-month high near 63%, the data confirms the broader buying trend hasn’t broken. Sponsored This behavior matters because it offsets short-term selling from whales. As long-term holders absorb the coins moving to exchanges, it prevents deeper pullbacks and keeps the structure stable. That’s what keeps the door open for a renewed push if momentum returns. Bitcoin Price Structure And Why The Recovery Is Expected Bitcoin’s current setup still follows a clear technical structure, an inverse head and shoulders pattern, which often signals a shift from selling to buying momentum. The formation remains valid as long as BTC holds above $106,600, which acts as the base of the pattern. Sponsored The Relative Strength Index (RSI), an indicator that measures how strong buying or selling momentum is, first flashed a hidden bearish divergence between October 13 and 26, right around the time the breakout attempt formed. During that period, the Bitcoin price made a lower high, while RSI made a higher high, signaling that momentum was weakening even as traders pushed the price up. That imbalance was the reason many expected a possible breakout failure near $115,000. And that’s exactly what followed — a rejection and short-term correction. Now, the divergence has flattened out, meaning RSI and the Bitcoin price are moving in sync again. This stabilization shows that sellers are losing steam and that the setup for recovery is building strength. However, $115,000 remains the key test. It’s the level that capped the last breakout and will decide whether this pattern continues to evolve higher. If Bitcoin closes decisively above it, the neckline breakout could open the path toward $117,300 and $125,900 (near BTC’s peak). That would be an 11% gain from the current zone. If the BTC price fails and slips below $106,600, that would invalidate the bullish setup. It could even send BTC toward $103,500.

        "content": "How Dollar Breakouts Have Nailed Bitcoin Peaks: Is Another Top in the Works? Historical precedent suggests potential U.S. dollar strength could trigger another Bitcoin top, but an analyst says otherwise. In brief The U.S. dollar’s recent consolidation and potential breakout could trigger another potential top for Bitcoin. Analysts argue that institutional accumulation has fundamentally changed Bitcoin’s market structure. A 15% to 25% correction in Bitcoin is likely if the dollar index breaks out above 100, according to analysts. Decrypt’s Art, Fashion, and Entertainment Hub. A historical pattern linking U.S. dollar breakouts to Bitcoin market tops has pitted cyclical believers against institutional accumulators, leaving investors divided over Bitcoin’s short- to medium-term future. As a result, investors are torn over what Bitcoin’s short to medium-term future holds. On the one hand, Bitcoin OGs and whales, who believe in the crypto market’s four-year cycle, have resorted to selling their holdings and shorting . Institutions, on the other hand, continue to accumulate Bitcoin at an unprecedented rate via exchange-traded funds or as part of their company’s treasury assets. The second cohort believes in the “debasement trade” and expects erosion of trust in the U.S. dollar to fuel capital rotation into gold and Bitcoin, both of which are considered stores of value. The dollar's influence on Bitcoin Bitcoin, like other risk assets, is sensitive to macroeconomic and policy changes. A strong U.S. dollar often attracts investors to safe assets, such as bonds or T-bills, which in turn causes risky assets to decline. Macroeconomic policy changes, including central bank interest rate hikes, often trigger a sell-off in equities and crypto markets. “For me, the most important chart is this one,” Jamie Coutts, chief crypto analyst at Realvision, tweeted on Wednesday, highlighting how the dollar index’s strength has consistently marked cycle peaks for Bitcoin. For me the most important chart is this one pic.twitter.com/g97rJs8rEg — Jamie Coutts CMT (@Jamie1Coutts) October 28, 2025 In each instance, the DXY index often coiled up, forming a bottom. Such range-tightening behavior was followed by a breakout to the upside, showcasing the dollar’s strength and marking bull run tops for Bitcoin. With a few exceptions, DXY has been stuck under 100, a key psychological level, since the second quarter of 2025. Coutts doesn’t specifically point to a potential top formation for Bitcoin. The central question remains: “Will history repeat?” Is Bitcoin forming a top? Despite the historical precedent, “Bitcoin-dollar inverse correlation holds less than 30% of the time historically,” Derek Lim, head of research at crypto market-making firm Caladan, told Decrypt . Lim pointed to the new dynamics introduced by institutional capital to support his outlook. “The $150 to 170 billion in spot ETF assets didn't exist in 2021,” the analyst said, suggesting the market is now dominated by “price-insensitive long-term holders.” This new foundation is evidenced by a “daily volatility that declined 57% from 4.2% pre-ETF to 1.8% post-ETF,” he added. The analyst added that the macroeconomic backdrop also contrasts sharply with previous cycles. Between 2021 and 2022, the U.S. Federal Reserve hiked rates nine consecutive times, totaling 525 basis points. Today, with the Fed having already begun an easing cycle, the pressure from the dollar may be less intense. On prediction market Myriad , launched by Decrypt 's parent company Dastan, users place a 65% chance on Bitcoin pumping to $120,000 rather than dumping to $100,000. However, Lim does not discount a potential correction should the dollar bounce from current levels. “If DXY rallies from 98.67 to 105-108, historical correlation suggests Bitcoin could correct 15% to 25%,\" Lim said, placing it in the $85,000 to $95,000 range and opening the door for \"aggressive\" institutional buying. Despite this risk, the analyst maintains a moderately bullish stance for the fourth quarter, forecasting a potential consolidation around $110,000, followed by an uptrend to $125,000 or $135,000 before 2025 ends. The bullish view is supported by an easing macroeconomic outlook, including the Fed's dovish stance, coupled with fundamental catalysts such as supply shocks from ETF-driven accumulation and hopes of a sustained weakness in the U.S. dollar.

        "content": "The Federal Reserve will make its latest interest rates decision on Wednesday, in what is shaping up to be a consequential week for Bitcoin.Analysts are widely expecting that the central bank’s chair Jerome Powell will unveil another 0.25 percentage point reduction — to a range of between 3.75% and 4%.And given that the Fed previously signaled that it is pencilling in two further rate cuts for 2025, we’re expecting to see a repeat performance in December too. Generally speaking, lower interest rates are good news for BTC — for multiple reasons. The Federal Reserve’s cuts trickle down to savings accounts and bonds, prompting investors to seek healthier returns elsewhere. Increased liquidity also helps capital flow into riskier assets, especially if the dollar ends up weakening as a result.However, if you’re expecting Bitcoin to surge higher as soon as Powell gives his news conference, prepare to be disappointed. The response on the crypto markets can be pretty muted when a cut is expected — or “priced in.” Policymakers on the Federal Open Markets Committee have been pretty reluctant to slash the cost of borrowing, despite protests from Donald Trump, with this year’s first cut only coming into effect in September. A month after that announcement, BTC had actually fallen by 8.56%.Bitcoin (BTC)24h7d30d1yAll timeFXTM’s senior market analyst Lukman Otunuga told Cryptonews that the Fed’s decision may not end up being the biggest driver for Bitcoin this week, as a multitude of other factors are at play.US President Donald Trump is set to meet his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping on Thursday, with the markets looking for signs of a thaw in the escalating trade war between both countries. Trump’s announcement of fresh tariffs on Beijing earlier this month led to a violent correction across major cryptocurrencies.It’s also a big week for the tech sector — with the likes of Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Apple all reporting earnings this week. Given these giant companies have a collective market capitalization of $15 trillion, their performance could have a huge impact on the stock market — especially the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 — which could help Bitcoin nudge higher. Otunuga added:“Global equity bulls have regained control as optimism over a potential US–China breakthrough sparks risk appetite. But with central banks in the spotlight and Big Tech earnings on deck, markets could be in for another week of sharp twists and turns. Traders should brace for heightened volatility as policy decisions and corporate results dictate sentiment.”As with most Fed rate decisions, the remarks that Jerome Powell makes at his news conference — indicating where the central bank sees the US economy heading — could prove instructive.Even though a cut is now regarded as inevitable, not everyone thinks this is a smart move. Bloomberg’s editorial board recently published a piece in which it argued that a pause is more appropriate given there is “enormous uncertainty about where the economy is headed.” It pointed to how inflation remains stubbornly above the Fed’s target of 2% — and that’s before the true impact of tariffs begins to be felt by consumers. What’s more, with the government shutdown now set to enter a second month, its analysts argue that additional threats could be on the horizon, with crucial statistical releases now being delayed or canceled.“Understanding the state of the economy would be difficult enough with the data flowing as usual. Without it, the job is next to impossible.”Looking further ahead, a CNBC survey suggests there is a 54% chance of a third rate cut in January — and overall, it is expected that the Fed’s funds rate will tumble to 3.2% by the end of next year. This could deliver some much-needed relief to borrowers, albeit gradually.Given Bitcoin’s sensitivity to tech stocks, a bigger threat from this research concerns attitudes surrounding AI — with 80% of participants arguing equities in this still-nascent sector are “extremely or somewhat” overvalued. Economist John Lonski told the publication:“Once the AI bubble bursts, only the financially strong participants in the AI space will survive.”Any implosion there could leave BTC exceedingly vulnerable, as it would fuel a risk-off sentiment and dampen appetite for tech equities. While there may be market euphoria at the moment, with the S&P 500 hitting a fresh all-time high as recently as this week, there are no guarantees this will last.The post Big Week for Bitcoin as Federal Reserve Decision on Interest Rates Looms appeared first on Cryptonews.",

        "content": "Bitcoin whales have increased their transfers to centralized exchanges this month, amid volatile trading. Retail holders also moved along similar lines as predicted at the start of the short-term crunch. Meanwhile, analysts have questioned this round of inflows as traders are keen on new strategies. Binance Records 185,000 Bitcoin Inflows This month, Binance, the largest centralized exchange by trading volume, has recorded over 185,000 BTC in trading volume, up from previous months. According to CryptoQuant data , it’s the highest since July, before Bitcoin hit another all-time high. Generally, this pattern suggests massive incoming sales , as flows to centralized exchanges signal a bearish market outlook. As selling pressure increases, traders look to change patterns to end the year. CryptoQuant experts suggest that the move may not be an imminent sale but could lead to one. This means that traders are bidding for a perfect sell opportunity as the market recovers after the last dip. “ However, it may also reflect traders waiting for a specific selling opportunity, such as a sudden price spike, particularly since Bitcoin has not fallen below $100,000 despite the sharp fluctuations that occurred. This suggests that the movement may be a technical adjustment within the market cycle, reflecting investors’ reactions to current price levels rather than a wave of mass selling.” At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $115,390, up 2.2% over the last 24 hours. The recovery, despite recent centralized exchange leaning shows the massive sale hasn’t occurred as traders face the dilemma to back the asset in the coming months. Similarly, altcoins have also looked stable due to huge traditional inflows to Ethereum and Solana. It should be noted that out of the 185,000 Bitcoin inflows to Binance, over 45,000 are controlled by whales. These large holders shape market sentiment, causing retail to move likewise. “ Such a volume of whale activity suggests that large holders are in a market observation and repositioning phase rather than a disposal or liquidation phase. Historically, movements of this kind often precede increased activity in futures markets or a strategic adjustment of positions ahead of a potential new trend wave,” CryptoQuant analysts added. Furthermore, on-chain data shows that Bitcoin flipped the fear zone as sentiments moved into neutral territory. Over the weekend, traders notched slight gains due to expected macro tailwinds.",

        "content": "AfD proposes creating a national Bitcoin reserve to protect Germany’s economy from inflation risks. The plan could turn Germany into one of Europe’s leading Bitcoin-holding nations. Germany’s move may spark a European race to adopt Bitcoin as a sovereign asset. Germany’s right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, the second-largest opposition faction in the Bundestag, has introduced a motion to create a national Bitcoin reserve. If approved, this proposal could transform Germany from a Bitcoin seller into one of Europe’s top holders and potentially kickstart a new wave of crypto-driven financial strategy across the EU. Key Details of the Motion The AfD’s proposal comes at a time when traditional currencies are under growing pressure from inflation and central bank interventions. The party, known for its eurosceptic stance, argues that Bitcoin could serve as a financial safety net for Germany, similar to how gold once did. The AfD’s proposal calls for the federal government to acquire and hold a significant portion of Bitcoin, estimated at around 2% of the total supply, mirroring recent initiatives in France, where lawmaker Éric Ciotti has voiced similar intentions. The motion aims to use Bitcoin to strengthen Germany’s reserves amid inflation and global uncertainty. The finance ministry will now review how to store it securely and align it with EU financial rules. BREAKING: 🇩🇪 Germany’s AfD party has introduced a motion to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Countries are in FOMO. pic.twitter.com/cQntUoh5Cm Germany’s Shift from Selling to Storing Ironically, this proposal follows Germany’s massive sale of nearly 50,000 seized BTC last year, coins originally seized from criminal investigations. However, it could have been worth more than $6.5 billion, at current prices near $113,000. Critics within the crypto community viewed that sale as a costly mistake, claiming it showed short-term thinking at the government level. Now, AfD’s move appears to flip that narrative, suggesting Germany should have held onto its Bitcoin instead of liquidating it. Other Countries are in FOMO If the motion is approved, Germany could become one of the first major economies to include Bitcoin in its national reserves. Interestingly, if Germany and France both proceed, it could spark a European race to accumulate Bitcoin as a sovereign asset. Experts say many countries, especially in Europe and Asia, are watching Germany’s move closely. Governments now see Bitcoin not just as an investment, but as a tool to strengthen their economies.",

        "content": "The long-running Mt. Gox story is not over yet. According to Cointelegraph, the defunct Japanese crypto exchange has pushed back its plan to repay about $4 billion in Bitcoin until 2026. The repayments were expected to start in October 2025, but the trustee who manages the case says they need more time. This Mt. Gox delay frustrates many creditors, yet it may also bring some relief to Bitcoin traders.Why the Delay MattersMt. Gox still controls around 34,000 BTC, worth nearly $4 billion. These coins have remained locked since 2014 when hackers stole about 850,000 Bitcoin and forced the exchange to shut down.If the repayments had begun next year, many creditors might have sold their coins right away. That move could have flooded the market and pushed prices lower. The delay now means the extra supply won’t appear for at least another year, giving Bitcoin more space to breathe.With fewer coins ready to sell, the market might stay more stable or even trend upward.Why Some Think It’s BullishMany analysts believe the delay could turn out to be bullish for Bitcoin. Since fewer coins will enter circulation, selling pressure stays low, which usually helps the price.The timing also works in Bitcoin’s favor. The crypto market is slowly recovering as more investors and institutions return. By keeping $4 billion in BTC off the market, Mt. Gox removes one of the biggest short-term risks for traders.While creditors feel disappointed, the broader crypto space might quietly benefit.Creditors Still WaitingFor creditors, the wait drags on. Some have spent more than a decade trying to recover their funds. Each new delay adds to their frustration.The trustee says the team needs extra time to process repayments properly and meet all of the requirements. However, there is no confirmed repayment date yet. If the process finally begins in late 2026, the market will watch how creditors react.A sudden wave of selling could still bring short-term pressure on Bitcoin’s price.How It Affects BitcoinRight now, the delay takes away a big worry for traders. With billions in Bitcoin staying off the market, volatility may ease for a while.This case also shows how complex crypto bankruptcies can be. But for now, Bitcoin has a moment of calm before the next big move.A Pause That Strengthens BitcoinMt. Gox’s delay may test creditors’ patience, but it gives Bitcoin a break. By keeping $4 billion in BTC locked for another year, the market avoids sudden selling and gets more time to strengthen. For creditors, the wait continues. But for Bitcoin, this pause might be a quiet win.The post Mt. Gox Delay Pushes $4B Bitcoin Payout to 2026 appeared first on Coinfomania.",

        "content": "With those two anchors relatively stable, investors hunt for asymmetric opportunities — the so-called convexity trades that can deliver large upside from modest capital. This article compares CTK (ConstructKoin) presale exposure to core L1 holdings (BTC/ETH) and explains why a disciplined ReFi presale can offer higher convexity — if and only if execution, compliance, and verifiable pilots line up. Founder Chris Chourio’s roadmap is central to that argument.What we mean by convexity hereConvexity in crypto terms = asymmetric upside potential relative to downside risk. Blue-chip L1s (BTC, ETH) offer lower downside volatility and steady upside tied to macro and network adoption. Presale tokens like CTK are higher risk but can produce substantially larger percentage returns if the project (1) proves product-market fit, (2) lands institutional partners, and (3) executes milestones reliably.BTC & ETH — the baselineBitcoin: macro liquidity magnet. When BTC rallies, it enlarges the market’s risk budget. BTC is the slow-but-steady backbone many institutions allocate to first.Ethereum: the developer and settlement hub. ETH’s strength improves the utility and tool-chains (oracles, L2s) that presales use to prove off-chain events on-chain.Holding BTC/ETH is a defensive growth posture. Allocators usually allocate a small “opportunity” bucket for higher-convexity bets — that’s where presales live.CTK presale: why it’s structured for institutional convexityConstructKoin (CTK) is designed as a presale for ReFi infrastructure, not a speculative memetoken. Key features that create asymmetric upside potential:Milestone-driven funding (phased presale): CTK’s multi-phase presale releases capital against verifiable product and pilot milestones — reducing the “one-shot” dilution risk and aligning price discovery with execution.Real-world revenue pathway: CTK funds property-development finance flows, creating potential repeatable cashflows tied to repayments and fees.Compliance-first build: integrated KYC/AML, audit trails, and legal frameworks make it more palatable to conservative capital — increasing the chance of larger institutional allocations if pilots succeed.Chain-agnostic proofs: CTK plans to use L1/L2 settlement and oracle layers (including ETH L2s) for attestation, meaning it leverages existing technical rails rather than inventing them.These design choices increase the conditional convexity: upside is larger than a random presale because hitting milestones materially de-risks the project for bigger buyers.CTK presale vs holding L1s — practical tradeoffsDownside protection: BTC/ETH have deeper liquidity and institutional custody; CTK presale liquidity is limited early — meaning greater downside risk if execution stalls.Upside potential: a successful CTK runway of pilots + lender onboarding could deliver outsized returns compared to incremental L1 gains.Time to monetization: L1 upside can be realized with market moves; CTK requires operational milestones (pilot closings, tranche releases).Institutional interest: CTK’s compliance posture and tranche funding are intentionally designed to convert cautious institutional curiosity into meaningful capital — a structural advantage over typical presales.Catalysts that turn CTK’s convexity realSigned pilot financing deals with regional developers and lenders.Independent audits that validate milestone-verification mechanics.Demonstrable tranche releases tied to measurable KPIs.Initial exchange/OTC windows enabling scaled institutional entry.Risks — don’t ignore themRegulatory complexity, partner execution failures, and unreliable oracle attestations are real risks. Investors should judge CTK by verifiable milestones — not price chatter.Final thoughtBTC and ETH supply the runway; high-convexity bets like CTK can take off only when execution and compliance convert interest into institutional capital. ConstructKoin’s phased presale and compliance-first architecture create a conditional pathway to higher convexity — but it’s a results-driven play. If CTK proves pilots and secures lender commitments, the presale could outperform standard L1 exposure in percentage terms. Until then, it remains a strategic, higher-risk allocation for diversified portfolios.Name: Construct Koin (CTK)Telegram: https://t.me/constructkoinTwitter: https://x.com/constructkoinWebsite: https://constructkoin.comThis publication is sponsored.

Given that the Stochastic RSI indicators for this time frame have just ticked up, the breakout would be more likely to the upside. A higher high above $116,430 would be the first target. The Federal Reserve announcement on a probable 25 basis points rate cut later on Wednesday could also provide fuel for the fire. W pattern playing out so far Source: TradingView The daily chart gives a better view of the W pattern that formed below the major trendline. So far, this has broken to the upside and has now come back to confirm the break at the neckline. A bounce would be expected from here. Huge 8-year trendline breakout on the horizon Source: TradingView The 2-week chart for the $BTC price illustrates the trajectories of this, and the previous bull markets. It can be seen that either the 8-year ascending trendline or the current bull market parabola will have to break. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI indicators are coming down fast. Could they begin to reverse at the 25.00 level, as has happened before? The weekly Stochastic RSI indicators have already bottomed and crossed back up, so if the 2-week indicators also do so, this will signal massive upside price momentum. A break above the 8-year trendline looks to be the more probable outcome. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Home » Market Updates Summarize with AI Summarize with AI The cryptocurrency market, which started the new business week on the right foot, lost some ground over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin (BTC) briefly dipped to almost $112,000, while Ethereum (ETH) and many other leading altcoins have also posted losses. Pi Network’s PI is in the opposite corner with a double-digit gain. BTC Slips Ahead of Fed’s Decision The primary cryptocurrency registered an impressive uptick on Monday (October 27), temporarily climbing above $116,000. It surpassed that level yesterday, too, but since then, BTC has been in an evident downtrend. Several hours ago, the price tumbled to approximately $112,300. The bulls managed to reclaim some lost ground, and as of this writing, Bitcoin is hovering around $113,000, representing a 1.2% decline on a daily scale. The heightened volatility comes just hours before the FOMC meeting, during which the Federal Reserve will decide whether to raise, lower, or keep interest rates in the United States unchanged. The odds of a 0.25% drop are almost certain (according to bets on Polymarket), and we will see how the official announcement impacts the crypto sector. According to some analysts, Bitcoin is at a crossroads and its valuation could either shoot above $120,000 or collapse well below $100K. Lower interest rates are generally considered good news for bulls, as they could dampen investor appetite for traditional financial products and encourage investment in digital assets. Following BTC’s price retreat over the past 24 hours, its market capitalization has headed south to around $2.25 trillion, while its dominance over the altcoins stands at nearly 59%. PI Enters Green Territory Ethereum (ETH) has followed BTC’s footsteps, plunging by 3% to under $4,000. Solana (SOL), Bittensor (TAO), Sui (SUI), Hedera (HBAR), and Ethena (ENA) are also among the biggest losers, with declines of 4-7%. Somewhat surprisingly, Pi Network’s native cryptocurrency is the best-performing digital asset (from the top 100 club) today, with its price spiking by 15% to $0.26. Other notable gainers include TRUMP (+13%) and M (+4%). The total cryptocurrency market capitalization has retraced by 1.7% in the last day to around $3.88 trillion.

        "content": "Quick Facts:1⃣ Uphold has announced its integration with the Exactly Protocol, allowing its customers to earn yield or access credit through their crypto holdings.2⃣ The service will be launched in Florida and Latin America in December, with expansion to the greater US in Q1 2026.3⃣ Uphold will support and expand the utility of several cryptocurrencies, including $BTC, $XRP, $ETH, and $USDC.4⃣ Similarly, Bitcoin Hyper will unlock $BTC’s utility to include staking, trading, and interacting with dApps.Uphold, a fintech company offering on-chain finance solutions, yesterday announced that it will integrate with the Exactly Protocol. This will enable its customers to earn yield or access credit through their cryptocurrencies, such as XRP ($XRP) and Bitcoin ($BTC).Launching in December, the service will initially be available in Florida and Latin America. Further expansion in the US is planned in Q1 2026.The service is set to increase the utility of major cryptocurrencies aside from merely being a store of value. This is similar to Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), a project that aims to expand $BTC’s utility via its Layer-2 network.Uphold to Simplify Borrowing vs Traditional BanksIn a post on X, Uphold quoted its CEO, Simon McLoughlin, who says that its integration with the Exactly Protocol will enable customers to borrow against or earn yield on their digital assets, ‘any time, without credit checks, at lower rates than traditional banks.’Through this service, customers will be able to get more out of their crypto holdings, according to McLoughlin in a statement on Business Insider. That’s because they’ll be able to unlock more value out of their digital assets aside from merely waiting for their value to appreciate.Uphold will support several digital assets when its service launches in December. These include Circle ($USDC) and Ethereum ($ETH), along with $XRP and $BTC.Bitcoin Hyper: Unlocking Your Bitcoin’s PotentialSimilar to Uphold’s approach to expanding the utility of major cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) will also unlock what your $BTC is capable of.As it is, a Bitcoin is only good as a store of value. This means that you can’t use it for more advanced applications, such as staking.Bitcoin Hyper is set to change that when it launches its Layer-2 network. It will employ a canonical bridge that will allow you to send your $BTC from the main Bitcoin network to the L2 and use it for various applications, including staking, trading, and interacting with dApps.If you think your $BTC is valuable now, imagine how much more valuable it will become when you’re finally able to unlock its true potential.Plus, the L2 will integrate the Solana Virtual Machine. Doing so will deliver Solana-level speeds and low transaction costs that will be necessary for using your $BTC for more advanced applications. To learn more about the project, be sure to check out our comprehensive Bitcoin Hyper review.To get the most out of Bitcoin Hyper, you’ll need to hold its native $HYPER token. While you can use it to pay for transaction fees, it’ll also provide you with additional perks, including governance rights and access to exclusive features on the L2.For now, you can buy $HYPER tokens via the official Bitcoin Hyper presale page. Each one costs a very affordable $0.013185, which you can also stake to earn rewards set at 47% p.a. Our guide to buying Bitcoin Hyper provides you with step-by-step instructions on how to get your share of $HYPER tokens.You can also HODL tokens if you prefer. This is ideal if you want your investment to appreciate further. According to our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction, the token has the potential to go 10x and hit a high of $0.20 by 2026, and even $1.50 by 2030.You need to hurry, though, as there’s another price increase happening in a few hours. So, if you want to lock in $HYPER’s current price, now is the time.When you do, you’ll be a part of the growing number of investors supporting the project. To date, the presale has raised over $25.1M, easily making it one of this year’s best crypto presales. That’s proof enough of the buzz the presale has generated since it began.Don’t be left behind – join the Bitcoin Hyper presale today.Disclaimer: Do your own research.

        "description": "Bitcoin’s price cycles appear to be shifting as institutional capital and global liquidity replace halvings as key market drivers, with analysts expecting the bull phase to continue into 2026.The post Is Bitcoin Outgrowing Its 4-Year Cycle? 2026 Could Mark a Turning Point appeared first on BeInCrypto.",
        "content": "According to Bitcoin’s traditional four-year cycle, 2026 could mark the onset of a bear market for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. However, many analysts suggest that this familiar pattern may no longer apply in today’s market.This shift reflects a market now influenced more by institutional capital and global liquidity than by protocol events. This maturation may redefine Bitcoin’s trajectory through 2026.Bitcoin Outlook 2026: Beyond the 4-Year Cycle PatternIn a recent post on X, veteran trader Bob Loukas observed that the current Bitcoin cycle differs from previous ones. He cautioned investors against rigid expectations, noting that a continued advance into the first or even second quarter of next year would still fall within the cycle’s normal bounds.“This 4 yr cycle has been different to the priors, in many ways. And has a different class of participants. Therefore, we shouldn’t be too absolute in expectations. We need to give it room within the bounds of the cycle. As in, a move to a Q1 or even Q2. Well within the range of the cycle that affords room for the normal bear phase. 6-8 months would suffice,” Loukas wrote.Nonetheless, other market watchers believe that BTC now follows a 5-year cycle instead of a 4-year one. In a detailed post, an analyst highlighted that for over a decade, Bitcoin’s price followed a clear pattern connected to its four-year halving events. Each cycle delivered massive percentage gains, 9,300% in 2013, 2,300% in 2017, and 260% in 2021, followed by corrections of around 80%. However, data now shows this familiar structure is changing. Bitcoin’s Market Cycles: Source: X/BullTheoryioThe analyst observed that the post-2024 halving phase has produced only an 18% gain so far. This is a notable shift from previous periods. It indicates that Bitcoin is no longer following a fast halving-driven rhythm. Instead, it’s now reflecting slower global liquidity dynamics and institutional accumulation, with the bull phase likely extending through the first half of 2026.“Bitcoin has shifted from a 4-year to a 5-year cycle, with the next peak expected around Q2 2026. This is due to a deeper structural shift in the global economy, governments are rolling over debt for longer periods, business cycles are stretching out, and liquidity waves now moving through the system more slowly,” the post read.Other market watchers also agree that Bitcoin’s price moves are better explained by global liquidity cycles than halvings alone. A pseudonymous analyst, Master of Crypto, argued that halvings once mattered when Bitcoin was small and speculative, but today — as a $2.5 trillion asset — they have little real impact. The key driver now is global liquidity, not block rewards.When money supply (M2) expands, liquidity flows into risk assets like Bitcoin, lifting its price. Conversely, when liquidity tightens, Bitcoin slows down. This pattern, he notes, held true in 2020, 2022, and 2023.“That’s why 2025–2026 still look bullish. Global liquidity is rising once more. Japan, China, and the U.S. are all adding money in their own ways. Bitcoin will soak up a big part of those inflows. BTC in 2025 isn’t the same as BTC in 2013. It’s no longer just a retail-driven cycle play,” the analyst claimed.Bitcoin’s Movements Driven By Global Liquidity. Source: X/MasterCryptoHqSo, it’s clear that Bitcoin’s market behavior is changing. While halvings still hold psychological significance, their direct impact on price appears to be diminishing. The cryptocurrency’s movements are now intertwined with global liquidity trends, institutional participation, and macroeconomic policy shifts.As capital cycles stretch and liquidity waves move more slowly, Bitcoin’s next major peak — expected by some around mid-2026 — may confirm that the era of predictable four-year cycles is coming to an end.The post Is Bitcoin Outgrowing Its 4-Year Cycle? 2026 Could Mark a Turning Point appeared first on BeInCrypto.",

        "description": "Robert Kiyosaki reaffirmed his bullish stance on Bitcoin, predicting it could hit $200,000 this year. He attributed wealth differences to emotional intelligence, arguing fear keeps people poor and EQ outweighs IQ.",
        "content": "Robert Kiyosaki, the author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, is doubling down on Bitcoin — and on his belief that fear, not intelligence, keeps people poor. In a fiery post on X (formerly Twitter) on Wednesday, Kiyosaki said he believes Bitcoin could “double in price this year... possibly a high of $200k”, while arguing that “losers lose” because they lack emotional intelligence, or “EQ”.Sharing what he described as a personal anecdote, Kiyosaki said he had shown a friend his Coinbase app, which “a few years ago was pathetic”. The account, he said, now holds “millions in Bitcoin”. Yet his friend, he noted, “could not see the millions in gain... all he could see was the thousands in losses”.“That psychological emotional difference is the key difference between the rich, poor and middle class,” Kiyosaki wrote. “It’s called EQ, or emotional intelligence.”According to him, “losers have low EQ. They live in the emotion known as fear,” while “the rich know that ‘fear’ and ‘greed’ are both EQs we all have... and the rich and successful respect both EQs.”“EQ is more powerful than IQ and that is why many highly educated people like my poor dad died poor,” Kiyosaki said, calling emotional intelligence “more important than IQ in the world of money.”Link to post: https://x.com/theRealKiyosaki/status/1983350338951504204Bitcoin trades steadyKiyosaki’s bullish remarks come as Bitcoin hovered around $113,125 on Wednesday, with short-term volatility driven by liquidations ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s policy decision and uncertainty over the U.S.–China trade deal.According to Edul Patel, CEO of Mudrex, Bitcoin is likely to remain range-bound “until there’s clarity on the Fed’s rate cut decision and the U.S.–China trade deal”, but any positive news “could put bulls back in control”, pushing BTC past resistance at $117,400.Support for the world’s largest cryptocurrency remains firm around $107,800, Patel said.The CoinDCX Research Team noted that Bitcoin “yet again faced a strong rejection from local highs above $116,000”, while Ethereum slipped below $4,000 and other major altcoins including Solana, Dogecoin, and Cardano traded lower.A long-running faith in scarce assetsKiyosaki’s latest post builds on his long-held distrust of fiat money and preference for scarce assets such as Bitcoin, gold, and silver. Earlier this month, he urged investors to “not be late” in buying Bitcoin, warning that its supply is “running low” as the number of coins yet to be mined falls below two million.As he summed it up in his latest post: “If you want to be rich and happy... it is important you have high EQ which means being smarter than your greed and fear. Take care.” Also read | Azim Premji-backed PI Opportunities Fund to pocket Rs 350 crore, set for a 1,565% windfall in Lenskart IPO(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

        "content": "Bitcoin price today: Explore the latest crypto market update as BTC stalls above $113,000 amid stock surges and Fed anticipation. Stay informed on key levels and ETF flows for smarter investing. Read now for insights! What is the Bitcoin price today and why is it stalling? Bitcoin price today stands just above $113,000, marking a period of consolidation after rebounding from $107,000 lows. This stall comes as the cryptocurrency navigates a tight trading range influenced by subdued spot ETF inflows and broader market uncertainties. While positive netflows offer some support, the pace remains slower than in prior bull runs, keeping Bitcoin pinned between $111,000 support and $117,000 resistance. The ongoing global stock market rally, particularly led by technology sectors, is creating a mixed environment for Bitcoin. Nvidia’s shares surged nearly 2% in after-hours trading, pushing the chipmaker to a record above $204 and highlighting the AI boom’s momentum. This enthusiasm has spilled over into Asian markets, where Japan’s Nikkei 225 climbed 2.17% to a new high of 51,307.65, though the gains were highly concentrated in just a few stocks like Advantest Corp. and SoftBank, as noted by Bloomberg data. South Korea’s Kospi index rose 1.76%, driven by tech performers, while China’s Shanghai Composite edged up 0.69% to 4,015.83. In contrast, Australia’s ASX 200 fell 0.96% following hotter-than-expected Q3 consumer price data at 3.2% from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. These movements underscore a risk-on sentiment in equities, which often correlates with crypto gains, but Bitcoin’s muted response suggests caution amid pending macroeconomic events. European markets are poised for a cautious open, with Germany’s DAX futures down 0.4% and France’s CAC 40 off 0.16%, according to IG data. Investors are fixated on Jerome Powell’s upcoming Federal Reserve announcement, with the CNBC Fed Survey indicating 84% of traders anticipate a rate cut in December and 54% expecting another in January. Such easing could lower borrowing costs and bolster risk assets like Bitcoin, but any hawkish surprises might pressure prices lower. Overall, the stock rally provides tailwinds, yet Bitcoin’s stall reflects selective participation in the broader uptrend. Frequently Asked Questions Bitcoin’s trading range above $113,000 is shaped by several key factors, including modest spot ETF netflows of under 1,000 BTC per day, which lag behind the 2,500+ BTC seen in earlier rallies. Support at $111,000 has held firm since the rebound from $107,000, while resistance at $117,000 persists near the all-time high of over $125,000. Traders are also monitoring Federal Reserve signals and global equity flows for directional cues. Yes, the Federal Reserve’s upcoming rate decision could significantly sway Bitcoin price today. With markets pricing in 100 basis points of cuts by the end of 2026—potentially dropping the fed funds rate to 3.2%—a dovish stance from Jerome Powell might fuel further crypto upside by encouraging investment in high-risk assets. Conversely, a more conservative outlook could reinforce the current stall around $113,000, as lower rates historically support Bitcoin’s appeal as an inflation hedge. Key Takeaways In summary, the Bitcoin price today reflects a cautious consolidation above $113,000, intertwined with global stock rallies and anticipation for Federal Reserve actions. As Nvidia’s AI surge and concentrated Asian gains highlight market breadth concerns, Bitcoin’s performance hinges on ETF momentum and monetary policy signals. Looking ahead, dovish Fed tones could unlock new highs, empowering investors to navigate this dynamic landscape with informed strategies—stay tuned for evolving crypto market updates.

        "content": "Former US SEC Chair Gary Gensler has reiterated Bitcoin’s superiority over other cryptocurrencies, pointing to the asset’s rising popularity. However, Gensler disclosed that he holds no BTC despite its growing acceptance among retail and institutional investors. Bitcoin Is Akin To Gold, But Gensler Steers Clear Gary Gensler, former head of the US SEC, has revealed that he does not own any Bitcoins, months after handing over the reins of the securities regulator. Gensler revealed his stance in a CNBC interview , noting that he has never held any BTC or other cryptocurrencies despite their growing mainstream acceptance. While Gensler did not give a clear-cut reason for his hard stance against Bitcoin ownership, the former SEC Chair referred to the premier cryptocurrency as a “ highly speculative ” and “volatile asset.” Typically, SEC Chairs are strongly discouraged from owning Bitcoin over conflict-of-interest concerns, but Gensler downplayed speculations of owning BTC in the near future. However, Gensler underscored Bitcoin’s rising popularity, noting that several retail and institutional investors are trading the cryptocurrency. The former SEC Chair equated Bitcoin’s rise in popularity to gold, hinting that the cryptocurrency can achieve the same mainstream status as the precious metal. “Bitcoin is a highly speculative, volatile asset, but 7 billion people want to trade it,” said Gensler. “Just like we had gold for 10,000 years, we have Bitcoin.” Despite poking holes in the asset’s volatility, the ex-SEC Chair noted that Bitcoin is heads and shoulders above other cryptocurrencies. He added that other altcoins must demonstrate real-world utility and sound fundamentals to remain relevant in the long run. “These other thousands of projects need to show their use case and show that they actually have fundamentals underlying that, or they won’t persist,” added Gensler. Back in September, Gensler opined that, aside from BTC, most cryptocurrencies are not tied to any fundamentals and are largely driven by hype. Prior to his assuming office as SEC Chair in 2021, Gensler taught the “Blockchain and Money” course at the MIT Sloan School of Management, stoking enthusiasm for a crypto-friendly stance. However, Gensler’s time as the SEC Chair has since drawn fierce criticisms from industry stakeholders over its reliance on regulation by enforcement, marked by lawsuits against key sector players. Yet Gensler says he has no regrets about his handling of the SEC, despite the agency’s changing stance on digital assets under Paul Atkin’s leadership .",

France’s Existing Crypto Infrastructure Foundation In an additional crypto news update, France ranked among the first tier of prospective EU crypto hubs, particularly for stablecoins, custody, and tokenized markets infrastructure. The Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation’s Crypto-Asset Service Provider rules took effect on December 30, 2024, and France granted existing Autorité des marchés financiers-registered firms an 18-month runway to July 1, 2026. The combination of early regulatory clarity and an extended transition period kept activity onshore while firms upgraded to MiCA compliance. Circle chose Paris as its EU headquarters, received an Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de résolution e-money license, and began issuing USDC and EURC under MiCA’s Titles III and IV, effective June 30, 2024. That decision anchored euro- and dollar-stablecoin issuance in France and demonstrated regulator capacity to handle marquee firms. The Banque de France led the Eurosystem’s wholesale central bank digital currency. It distributed ledger technology settlement trials, and French authorities implemented the EU’s DLT Pilot Regime to test tokenized securities at scale. Paris hosted global platforms such as Ledger, Sorare, and Kaiko, alongside a large pool of regulated digital asset service providers. The ecosystem depth provided talent, vendor coverage, and policy feedback loops that mattered for institutional adoption. France also maintained assertive supervision practices, pushing Brussels to tighten passporting rules and warning it could challenge firms licensed in softer jurisdictions. Crypto News: Enforcement Actions Signal Gatekeeping, Not Retreat French regulators escalated enforcement actions throughout 2024 and early 2025, but the probes reflected license gatekeeping rather than abandoning crypto hub ambitions. French prosecutors opened a judicial investigation into Binance on January 28 for alleged aggravated money laundering, tax fraud, and related offenses, covering activity from 2019 through 2024. The criminal case, run by JUNALCO in Paris, sat alongside earlier questions over marketing without authorization. Binance denied wrongdoing. The prudential regulator widened anti-money-laundering inspections across exchanges, including Coinhouse and Binance, as it determined which firms qualified as “fit and proper” for EU-wide MiCA authorization. Those supervisory checks, reported October 17 through 20, aimed to sort who received French-granted passports rather than imposing bans. The market conduct regulator expanded its blacklist of unauthorized crypto websites and clarified France’s MiCA transition, allowing already-registered providers to continue operating while upgrading to full CASP status. France also maintained assertive supervision practices, pushing Brussels to tighten passporting rules and warning it could challenge firms licensed in softer jurisdictions. The enforcement posture signaled an institution-friendly but compliance-heavy hub strategy prioritizing fewer, cleaner licenses over volume. Strategic Reserve Bill Implications for Paris Crypto Hub Status The Bitcoin strategic reserve proposal reinforced France’s positioning within Europe’s multi-polar crypto landscape. While licensing momentum remained distributed across Ireland, Luxembourg, Germany, and the Netherlands, France’s combination of stablecoin issuance infrastructure, tokenized finance trials, and now potential sovereign Bitcoin holdings created differentiation. The legislative signal suggested French policymakers viewed crypto-asset reserves as strategic rather than speculative, aligning with institutional custody and treasury management frameworks already developed through Circle’s operations and Banque de France experiments. France’s assertive regulatory stance boosted credibility with institutions seeking robust oversight, but it may have discouraged retail-facing platforms that prefer lighter-touch jurisdictions. The Bitcoin reserve bill indicated France prioritized institutional crypto infrastructure over retail exchange volume, consistent with its focus on stablecoin issuance, tokenized securities, and wholesale settlement rather than consumer trading platforms. The strategic reserve proposal could accelerate France’s status as a hub for sovereign and institutional crypto adoption, while leaving retail exchange activity to other European centers. The National Assembly resolution represented France’s most explicit statement that Bitcoin and cryptocurrency infrastructure constituted core monetary policy considerations rather than peripheral financial technology experiments. If approved, the reserve would position France as the first major EU economy to hold sovereign Bitcoin, potentially influencing other member states and accelerating the institutional legitimacy of crypto assets in European capital markets.

        "content": "С начала недели криптовалюта проекта Bitcoin (BTC) дешевеет на 0,45% к отметке $112 976. Формально результат отрицательный. Но главное другое. Бенчмарк смог подняться выше зоны сопротивления $109 000 — 111 000. Если ретест верхней границы $111 000 пройдет удачно, следующей целью роста станет сопротивление $119 000 — 121 000. BTC медленно сокращает отставание от Nasdaq 100 . На прошлой неделе они аномально разошлись. Главная криптовалюта в среду падала к $106 637. Это недалеко от минимум флеш-крэша от 10 октября $102 013. Высокотехнологичный индекс в прошлую среду тоже снижался. Провал отчетности Netflix (NFLX) и Tesla (TSLA) расстроил бенчмарк. Но делал он это уже вблизи исторического максимума. За следующую неделю оба актива выросли. Фьючерс на Nasdaq 100 обновляет исторические максимумы уже 4 торговых дня подряд. Bitcoin до рекорда $126 192 еще далековато. Но он вполне может к нему приблизиться. Техника не против. Нужно разрешение от главных событий недели. Здесь есть сложности. Сегодня вечером ФРС опубликует итоги заседания. От американского регулятора не хотят видеть сюрпризы. Ему просто нужно подтвердить консенсус. Снизить учетную ставку на 0,25 п.п. до 4,00%. И сократить или завершить программу количественного ужесточения (QT). Этого достаточно. Дальше участники торгов сами со временем докрутят логику процесса до следующего шага, запуска программы количественного смягчения (QE). Лучшего времени для криптовалют. Более рискованной выглядит публикация квартальных отчетов Microsoft (MSFT) и Alphabet (GOOG) . Главный вопрос третьего квартала, на сколько оправданны многомиллиардные расходы на ИИ. Судя по провалам отчетности Netflix (NFLX) и Tesla (TSLA), возможны неприятные сюрпризы. Это может больно ударить по фондовым индексам. Сейчас они очень хрупки. Ширина рынка рекордно низкая. До 80,0% компаний S&P 500 снижаются. Раллирует лишь мегакэпы. Дальше еще интересней. В четверг состоится разрекламированная встреча Дональда Трампа и Си Цзиньпина. Ожидания очень высокие. В провал никто не верит. Это видно по активному росту американских индексов и снижению золота. Отсюда опасения, что ассиметрия ожиданий может привести к разочарованию. Тогда сработает классика — продавай на фактах. Это надавит и на криптовалюты тоже. Крупные инвесторы практически ничего не делают. За прошлую неделю они продали акций Bitcoin-ETF IBIT от BlackRock, FBTC от Fidelity и GBTC от Grayscale на $ 191,8 млн. Это мизер. За этот неполный недельный отрезок они купили на $90,6 млн. Крупняк пока не хочет наращивать позиции. Они и так рекордно поставили на рост две недели назад $3,45 млрд. со средней ценой в районе $119 000 — 120 000. Получается, что восстановление Bitcoin к историческому максимуму уже совсем недалеко. Но риски событий этой недели, могут сдвинуть этот рост еще немного вправо. Возможно, на несколько недель вперед. Больше нашей аналитики, вы можете найти в телеграм-канале MayGarden",

        "content": "In recent crypto news, French lawmaker Eric Ciotti from the UDR party introduced a European resolution bill in the National Assembly on October 28 proposing that France establish a strategic Bitcoin (BTC) reserve.The resolution, designated Assemblée nationale n°1984, explicitly stated that it accompanied a separate legislative proposal aimed at adapting France to the new monetary order by embracing Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.Crypto News: Proposed Bitcoin Reserve Targets 420K BTC AcquisitionThe resolution called for France to purchase up to 420,000 BTC, representing approximately 2% of Bitcoin’s total capped supply of 21 million coins.Bradley Duke, Bitwise’s head of Europe, described the proposal as “huge” and noted that the move came amid already strong Bitcoin demand.Matt Hougan, Bitwise’s chief investment officer, stated that the market underestimated the likelihood that sovereigns would buy Bitcoin in size over the next few years.Hougan also pointed to underestimated factors, including the likelihood that the US would pass the Clarity Act in late 2025 or early 2026, accelerating tokenization and stablecoin growth, and rising popularity of the “debasement trade” in 2026.The French legislative proposal positioned Paris to front-run potential sovereign adoption trends that institutional observers viewed as inevitable but mispriced.Bitcoin accumulation by different institutions cohorts | Source: Bitcoin TreasuriesFrance’s Existing Crypto Infrastructure FoundationIn an additional crypto news update, France ranked among the first tier of prospective EU crypto hubs, particularly for stablecoins, custody, and tokenized markets infrastructure.The Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation’s Crypto-Asset Service Provider rules took effect on December 30, 2024, and France granted existing Autorité des marchés financiers-registered firms an 18-month runway to July 1, 2026.The combination of early regulatory clarity and an extended transition period kept activity onshore while firms upgraded to MiCA compliance.Circle chose Paris as its EU headquarters, received an Autorité de contrôle prudentiel et de résolution e-money license, and began issuing USDC and EURC under MiCA’s Titles III and IV, effective June 30, 2024.That decision anchored euro- and dollar-stablecoin issuance in France and demonstrated regulator capacity to handle marquee firms.The Banque de France led the Eurosystem’s wholesale central bank digital currency. It distributed ledger technology settlement trials, and French authorities implemented the EU’s DLT Pilot Regime to test tokenized securities at scale.Paris hosted global platforms such as Ledger, Sorare, and Kaiko, alongside a large pool of regulated digital asset service providers.The ecosystem depth provided talent, vendor coverage, and policy feedback loops that mattered for institutional adoption. France also maintained assertive supervision practices, pushing Brussels to tighten passporting rules and warning it could challenge firms licensed in softer jurisdictions.Crypto News: Enforcement Actions Signal Gatekeeping, Not RetreatFrench regulators escalated enforcement actions throughout 2024 and early 2025, but the probes reflected license gatekeeping rather than abandoning crypto hub ambitions.French prosecutors opened a judicial investigation into Binance on January 28 for alleged aggravated money laundering, tax fraud, and related offenses, covering activity from 2019 through 2024.The criminal case, run by JUNALCO in Paris, sat alongside earlier questions over marketing without authorization. Binance denied wrongdoing.The prudential regulator widened anti-money-laundering inspections across exchanges, including Coinhouse and Binance, as it determined which firms qualified as “fit and proper” for EU-wide MiCA authorization.Those supervisory checks, reported October 17 through 20, aimed to sort who received French-granted passports rather than imposing bans.The market conduct regulator expanded its blacklist of unauthorized crypto websites and clarified France’s MiCA transition, allowing already-registered providers to continue operating while upgrading to full CASP status.France also maintained assertive supervision practices, pushing Brussels to tighten passporting rules and warning it could challenge firms licensed in softer jurisdictions.The enforcement posture signaled an institution-friendly but compliance-heavy hub strategy prioritizing fewer, cleaner licenses over volume.Strategic Reserve Bill Implications for Paris Crypto Hub StatusThe Bitcoin strategic reserve proposal reinforced France’s positioning within Europe’s multi-polar crypto landscape.While licensing momentum remained distributed across Ireland, Luxembourg, Germany, and the Netherlands, France’s combination of stablecoin issuance infrastructure, tokenized finance trials, and now potential sovereign Bitcoin holdings created differentiation.The legislative signal suggested French policymakers viewed crypto-asset reserves as strategic rather than speculative, aligning with institutional custody and treasury management frameworks already developed through Circle’s operations and Banque de France experiments.France’s assertive regulatory stance boosted credibility with institutions seeking robust oversight, but it may have discouraged retail-facing platforms that prefer lighter-touch jurisdictions.The Bitcoin reserve bill indicated France prioritized institutional crypto infrastructure over retail exchange volume, consistent with its focus on stablecoin issuance, tokenized securities, and wholesale settlement rather than consumer trading platforms.The strategic reserve proposal could accelerate France’s status as a hub for sovereign and institutional crypto adoption, while leaving retail exchange activity to other European centers.The National Assembly resolution represented France’s most explicit statement that Bitcoin and cryptocurrency infrastructure constituted core monetary policy considerations rather than peripheral financial technology experiments.If approved, the reserve would position France as the first major EU economy to hold sovereign Bitcoin, potentially influencing other member states and accelerating the institutional legitimacy of crypto assets in European capital markets.The post Crypto News: France’s Proposed Bitcoin Reserve Could Make Paris the EU’s Leading Crypto Hub appeared first on The Coin Republic.",

Investors are watching Binance closely after recent shifts in BTC and stablecoin reserves. Data from October’s liquidation event shows early signs of accumulation in BTC. Analysts suggest that the current correction may be shorter than past cycles. The market appears to be forming conditions that could favor renewed bullish momentum.Binance BTC/Stablecoin Ratio Signals Potential BuyData shared by Darkfost on X shows that Binance’s BTC/Stablecoin reserve ratio is currently signaling a buy. The ratio measures how much BTC is held compared to stablecoins on the exchange. When stablecoins rise relative to BTC, it suggests capital is ready to flow into Bitcoin.The BTC Stablecoin reserve ratio on Binance Is flashing a buy signal.Following the liquidation event on October 10th, the market was heavily shaken. The spillover into the derivatives markets also affected the spot market, with significant moves seen across multiple levels.... pic.twitter.com/Fw19uHu6hA— Darkfost (@Darkfost_Coc) October 28, 2025Historically, similar signals coincided with strong BTC price rallies. The first occurred in January 2023, moving BTC from $16,600 to $24,800. Another in March 2023 pushed BTC from $20,300 to $73,000. The last signal in March 2025 drove prices from $78,600 to $123,500.The recent reserve trends show stablecoins increasing while BTC holdings decrease. Analysts interpret this as potential supply shock conditions. In simpler terms, there is more capital waiting to buy BTC, while fewer coins are available on the exchange.Darkfost notes that this setup often appears after deep corrections or bear-market phases. Its reappearance now suggests that market participants may find the current dip an opportunity to accumulate.Market Correction Appears Short, Analysts SuggestCryptoQuant data, shared by CryptosRus, indicates the ongoing BTC correction is smaller than previous cycles. INSIGHT: THE CORRECTION WON'T LAST LONG...Q1 2021 — enormous influx of capital into the market, signaling the cycle was nearing its end.

Both saw less capital inflow than the massive 2021 cycle.The smaller correction suggests the market may stabilize quickly. Investors are unlikely to face a prolonged downturn if the pattern continues. Current price data from CoinGecko shows BTC trading at $113,052, with a 24-hour volume of $68.6 billion. This represents a modest -1.25% dip over the past day and a 4.4% increase over the week.BTC price on CoinGeckoAnalysts point out that shorter corrections often follow cycles with lower market overheating. The probability that the current bullish trend has ended remains low. Observers recommend monitoring key reserve ratios and volume activity as indicators for potential price recovery.The rising stablecoins and falling BTC reserves suggest conditions may favor buyers. If patterns hold, Bitcoin could see renewed upward momentum in the coming weeks.The post Is Now the Time to Buy Bitcoin (BTC)? Experts Weigh In appeared first on Blockonomi.",

        "content": "Best Crypto to Buy Right Now (2025): Bitcoin Hyper, Ethereum, Shiba Inu, Cardano 10-29-2025 11:21 AM CET | Business, Economy, Finances, Banking & Insurance Press release from: CryptoTimes24 / PR Agency: CryptoTimes24 Best Crypto to Buy Right Now Markets feel lively again, but not every green candle deserves your trust. If you're filtering for the best crypto to buy right now, start with tokens that keep people coming back tomorrow, real usage, clear shipping cadence, and enough liquidity to exit without a prayer. This short list stays practical. One fast-moving contender in Bitcoin's orbit, plus three heavyweight names with visible roadmaps and stubborn communities. No wild promises here, just what seems to be working and what might have legs into the next cycle. 1. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): BTC-Aligned Speed With Day-One Usability Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) ( ) pitches a Bitcoin-adjacent Layer-2 that aims for low fees and quick finality. The value prop is readable even if you don't live on Crypto Twitter, align with the biggest brand in the room, then make everyday actions cheap enough that people actually use the chain. Some holders report smooth early testing and a steady stream of dev updates. Staking mechanics nudge patience, while the \"bring your BTC energy to apps\" story travels well. Catalysts look straightforward: wallet integrations, thicker market-making, and listings that tighten spreads. If mainnet performance lands close to the pitch and tooling stays simple, $HYPER can graduate from curiosity to habit. Risks are the usual ones, delivery timelines, liquidity depth on new venues, and the challenge of standing out in a noisy L2 field. 2. Ethereum (ETH): Liquidity, Tooling, and an Endless Builder Base ETH remains the boring-in-a-good-way backbone. DeFi ( ), NFTs, real-world assets, rollups, the gravity well still point here. Gas relief via L2s continues to make day-to-day usage less painful, and devs keep shipping infra that most users never see yet everyone benefits from. It's not flashy, but the network effect is stubborn. Why it stays on buy lists: deep order books, battle-tested tooling, and a builder community that does not vanish when headlines cool. Staking adds a patient-holder angle. The flip side, fee spikes can return when activity bursts, and regulatory noise occasionally spooks the room. Even so, ETH tends to be where new crypto ideas find their first serious footing. 3. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Meme Energy With a Growing Utility Spine SHIB ( ) started as a wink, then quietly built out an ecosystem that keeps fans occupied. Community is the moat here, large, loud, and weirdly good at turning excitement into recurring activity. Layer-2 efforts, burns, and new dApps give holders something to do besides refreshing price feeds. Some community members say the cadence of updates feels steadier this year, which helps. The bet isn't complicated: if engagement loops tighten and more apps land where people already hang out, SHIB keeps showing up in retail-friendly portfolios. Risks remain obvious, it's a meme-rooted asset, so sentiment turns fast. Position sizing matters, especially when the timeline is measured in weeks, not epochs. 4. Cardano (ADA): Slow Cooker Approach, Research-First Culture ADA's vibe is methodical, fewer fireworks, more whiteboards. The chain keeps iterating, with steady upgrades and a developer community that prefers measured releases over headline sprints. That rhythm frustrates traders who want everything yesterday, yet it appeals to holders who'd rather see quiet delivery than sudden pivots. Why it earns a slot: consistency and a base that doesn't scare easily. As more tooling arrives and DeFi primitives mature, activity can thicken without drama. Real talk, execution speed will always be the criticism. If shipping stays predictable and apps solve actual problems, ADA keeps a seat at the table. Wrapping Up! Different profiles, different jobs.Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) targets speed in Bitcoin's shadow; ETH provides the rails and liquidity; SHIB harnesses community momentum with utility creeping in; ADA leans on patience and process. If you're hunting the best crypto to buy right now, set rules before you click buy, scale into strength, respect liquidity, and give yourself a clean exit if the story drifts. No crystal ball here, just dashboards, timelines, and the discipline to ignore loud but empty rooms.

        "content": "From Shiba Inu to Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): Traders scouting the best meme coins for the next breakout 10-29-2025 11:18 AM CET | Business, Economy, Finances, Banking & Insurance Press release from: CryptoTimes24 / PR Agency: CryptoTimes24 From Shiba Inu to Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) Instead of chasing every ticker, momentum hunters narrow in on assets that stay fast, low-cost, and reliable when traffic spikes. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) ( ) aims to keep activity flowing so traders can compound small moves without friction. The last cycle proved that story and community can move markets, but the next wave needs more than jokes. Traders screening for the best meme coins want culture plus real usability. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) targets that mix, pairing viral energy with smooth execution for everyday trading. From hype to horsepower Early meme runs often stalled when networks clogged, spreads widened, and gas costs ate profits. The modern playbook rewards projects that stay responsive even in heavy traffic. Bitcoin Hyper ( ) focuses on throughput, confirmation speed, and a clean path for integrations so market makers, retail traders, and creators can all interact without the usual bottlenecks. Why Bitcoin Hyper fits the best meme coins checklist Speed first: Fast confirmations help scalpers and copy traders avoid slippage spirals during news spikes. Low fees: Lightweight costs make micro entries and frequent position sizing realistic for small accounts. Staking and utility: A design that supports staking mechanics and ecosystem growth, not only speculation. Builder friendly: A roadmap oriented toward tools, integrations, and social features that amplify community loops. What that means on the desk With smoother execution, traders can ladder entries, recycle collateral, and hedge faster when momentum flips. That day to day usability is what separates temporary pumps from candidates that can sit near the top of any best meme coins list, and for quick cross-market checks many desks keep open to track liquidity, volume spikes, and relative strength in real time. Positioning before liquidity floods in Legacy names already command large valuations, which limits the math on 50x or 100x scenarios. For context, you can see live market data for Shiba Inu at and compare flows, volumes, and volatility against newer contenders to spot where risk to reward looks more favorable. When the cycle accelerates, capital usually rotates toward lower cap narratives with stronger tech and community reach. That is the pocket HYPER ( ) aims to occupy, pairing culture with performance so newcomers can join without tripping over fee spikes. Broader market dashboards help you track trend strength across majors and niche leaders as momentum shifts. Risk, rules, and realistic expectations Meme markets cut both ways, so sizing, rotation discipline, and exit plans matter as much as the entry. Treat Bitcoin Hyper like any speculative trade: research the roadmap, watch on-chain activity, and confirm that community engagement translates into real liquidity. If the 2025 bull phase expands, projects that balance culture with throughput could lead the pack, and that is exactly the lane where HYPER is trying to win.

Explore the implications and path ahead.The post MicroStrategy Nears S&P 500 Inclusion: A Watershed Moment for Bitcoin in Traditional Finance? appeared first on Cryptoboom.",
        "content": "October 29, 2025 – The financial world is abuzz with speculation as MicroStrategy (MSTR), the software firm famously turned Bitcoin corporate treasury, inches closer to potential inclusion in the prestigious S&P 500 index. Recent reports, buoyed by robust Q3 earnings and a unique corporate strategy that has seen its Bitcoin holdings swell, suggest a nearly 70% probability of MSTR joining the ranks of America’s largest publicly traded companies by year-end. Such an event would not only be a monumental achievement for MicroStrategy but could also represent a profound legitimization signal for Bitcoin within the echelons of traditional finance.MicroStrategy’s Unconventional Path to ProminenceUnder the visionary leadership of Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy embarked on an audacious strategy in 2020: converting its treasury assets into Bitcoin. This move, initially met with skepticism, has since transformed the company’s market perception and financial performance. While its core software business continues to operate, MSTR’s valuation has become inextricably linked to its extensive Bitcoin reserves, making it a de facto proxy for institutional Bitcoin exposure on traditional stock markets.Early Adopter: MicroStrategy was one of the first publicly traded companies to adopt Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset.Aggressive Accumulation: The company has consistently added to its Bitcoin holdings, accumulating hundreds of thousands of BTC over several years.Market Impact: MSTR’s strategy has influenced other corporations to explore Bitcoin as a treasury asset.S&P 500 Criteria and MSTR’s EligibilityInclusion in the S&P 500 is governed by stringent criteria, including market capitalization, liquidity, public float, and profitability over a trailing twelve-month period. For MSTR, its soaring market cap – heavily influenced by its Bitcoin holdings – and consistent positive earnings from its software division have propelled it into consideration. Analysts from firms like 10X Research have highlighted the company’s strong Q3 performance as a key factor strengthening its case.Market Cap: MSTR’s valuation has comfortably surpassed the minimum market cap requirements.Profitability: Recent quarters have shown consistent GAAP profitability, a crucial S&P criterion.Liquidity: The stock’s trading volume and public float meet index standards.Implications for Traditional Finance and BitcoinShould MicroStrategy be inducted into the S&P 500, the repercussions could be far-reaching:Mandatory Exposure: Index funds and ETFs tracking the S&P 500 would be mandated to purchase MSTR shares, indirectly increasing exposure to Bitcoin for countless traditional investors.Legitimization: It would signal a significant validation of Bitcoin’s role as a legitimate asset class, even for companies whose primary business isn’t crypto.Institutional Flows: Passive investment flows into MSTR could translate into indirect demand for Bitcoin, as MicroStrategy’s stock performance is closely tied to the digital asset’s value.Precedent Setting: This could pave the way for other Bitcoin-centric companies or those with significant crypto treasuries to gain traditional index recognition.Challenges and the Road AheadDespite the strong prospects, challenges remain. MicroStrategy’s valuation volatility, intrinsically linked to Bitcoin’s price swings, might be a point of consideration for some traditional index committees. Furthermore, the broader regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies, while maturing, could still present unforeseen hurdles. However, the momentum built over the past few years, coupled with a solid financial footing, positions MicroStrategy favorably for this potential landmark event.ConclusionMicroStrategy’s potential S&P 500 inclusion is more than just a corporate milestone; it’s a symbolic bridge between two previously disparate financial worlds. As of October 29, 2025, the likelihood appears high, promising to usher in a new era of mainstream recognition and indirect investment for Bitcoin within the established frameworks of global finance. This development underscores the inexorable march of digital assets into the heart of the traditional financial system.The post MicroStrategy Nears S&P 500 Inclusion: A Watershed Moment for Bitcoin in Traditional Finance? appeared first on Cryptoboom.",

While most cryptocurrencies recorded moderate growth in Q3 2025, XRP’s market capitalization and price surged significantly, reflecting renewed investor confidence and expanding real-world adoption.XRP Dominates Q3 2025 with $170B Market CapAccording to a recent Messari report, XRP outpaced Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana combined in market cap growth, a clear sign that investor sentiment toward the token is strengthening. XRP’s performance in the third quarter sparked optimism across the broader market.After months of quiet trading, XRP closed Q3 at $2.85, marking a 27% quarter-over-quarter increase, its strongest quarterly close ever. Its market cap rose 29% to $170.3 billion, surpassing the combined 13.3% growth of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. This remarkable performance signals a shift in market sentiment, as investors increasingly view XRP as a leading force in cross-border finance and tokenized assets.The XRP Ledger (XRPL) also reported strong network activity. Average daily transactions rose 9% to 1.8 million, while new wallet addresses increased 46% to over 447,000, highlighting growing user adoption.What’s Driving XRP’s Growth?XRP’s latest rally isn’t just about price appreciation; it’s being driven by real-world adoption and ecosystem expansion. Messari’s report revealed that several corporate players have started adding XRP to their treasury reserves. Companies such as Trident Digital, Webus, Wellgistics, and VivoPower, which invested $100 million in XRP, are among the early adopters. Ripple-backed Evernorth also made headlines after acquiring 388 million XRP, worth over $1 billion, making it one of the largest corporate holders of the token.The rise of the Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) trend has further enhanced XRP’s visibility among institutional investors looking for efficient, stable, and blockchain-based financial solutions. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ethereum Fusaka Upgrade Goes Live on Final Testnet Ahead of December 3 Mainnet Launch ,Expanding Ecosystem: Stablecoins and Real-World Assets (RWAs)Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin continues to gain traction, closing Q3 with a market cap of $88.8 million, up 34.7% from the previous quarter. Combined RLUSD supply across Ethereum and XRPL reached nearly $903 million by late October, showing strong momentum in multi-chain adoption.Meanwhile, the Real-World Asset (RWA) sector on XRPL saw explosive growth, jumping 215% to $364.2 million. Projects like OpenEden US Treasury Bill Vault, Montis Group Limited, and Ondo Short-Term Bond Fund are leading this expansion, driving greater institutional participation in tokenized finance.What’s Next for XRP?With sustained ecosystem growth, corporate backing, and increasing adoption of stablecoins and RWAs, XRP is positioning itself as a key player in the evolving global financial landscape. The launch of innovative products like Gemini’s XRP credit card and Flare’s FXRP DeFi integration further boosts its real-world utility.If this momentum continues, XRP could move well beyond its reputation as a payment-focused token, evolving into one of the most widely adopted digital assets, effectively bridging the gap between traditional finance and blockchain technology.

C’est encore trop tôt pour l’affirmer avec certitude, mais plusieurs signaux techniques invitent à la prudence. Pour l’instant, la tendance de fond reste haussière tant que le support mensuel des 102/106 000 $ tient . En dessous, on rentrerait dans une dynamique différente, avec un risque de basculement structurel et l’entrée définitive en bear market cylique. Mais nous n’en sommes pas là. Mais il reste couvert par une résistance technique extrême Sur le long terme, il y a un élément clé à surveiller : la grande résistance oblique qui relie tous les sommets depuis plus de 10 ans . Cette trendline historique passe précisément par la zone des 126 000 $. Le rejet observé début octobre n’est donc pas anodin, il correspond à un point de confluence majeur entre technique et cycle. Chaque sommet précédent (2013, 2017, 2021) s’était formé à proximité de cette même résistance. C’est ce qui rend la configuration actuelle particulièrement intéressante : soit le marché parvient à casser cette ligne pour valider une extension haussière inédite du cycle, soit on entre dans une phase de distribution à long terme. 👉 Retrouvez les meilleures plateformes pour acheter du Bitcoin Le ratio BTC/GOLD et la liquidité mondiale M2 en soutien Il y a un facteur de soutien sur le plan des arbitrages entre classes d’actifs. Le ratio BTC/GOLD est revenu tester un support de long terme , un niveau clé qui a historiquement marqué les fins de consolidations avant des phases d’expansion. Tant que ce ratio ne casse pas à la baisse, le momentum relatif du prix du Bitcoin face à l’or reste favorable. En d’autres termes, même si le BTC consolide, il conserve encore une dynamique macro supérieure à celle des actifs refuges. Autre facteur de poids : la liquidité mondiale (M2) , qui reste dans une phase d’expansion jusqu’à la fin de l’année en tant que « leading indicator » avec une projection temporelle de 12 semaines. Ce paramètre est souvent sous-estimé, mais il joue un rôle décisif dans les cycles des actifs risqués. Tant que la création monétaire nette reste positive, les corrections du Bitcoin ont tendance à être absorbées rapidement. Le marché reste porté par l’excès de liquidité, et la demande structurelle continue de croître, notamment via les flux institutionnels. En résumé, on se trouve probablement dans une zone charnière du cycle . Techniquement, la résistance majeure des 126 000 $ peut marquer un sommet provisoire, voire cyclique, mais tant que les 100/102 000 $ tiennent en clôture mensuelle, la tendance primaire demeure haussière. Une rupture nette de ce support en revanche serait la confirmation de l’entrée en bear market cyclique. #tazvcbap span::before { content: \" \"; background-image: url(https://cryptoast.fr/img/cta/research.svg);}#tazvcbap span {margin-bottom : 0em;} Retrouvez tous les jours des analyses exclusives de Vincent Ganne sur Cryptoast Academy",

Bitcoin-backed buybacks don't de-risk a treasury stock, they turn it into a levered, flow-driven bet on Bitcoin and premium cycles that can supercharge rallies and magnify the fade. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Yesterday, Oct. 28, Metaplanet authorized a share buyback program disclosing a Bitcoin ( BTC )-secured credit facility of up to $500 million. This capital allocation tool works best when the stock trades below its market-to-net-asset-value ratio, amplifying gains in Bitcoin rallies and magnifying losses in drawdowns. The Tokyo Stock Exchange filings set a buyback cap of ¥75 billion, or 150 million shares, over the next year, and approved a credit facility “secured by BTC” held with a custodian. For reference, Metaplanet holds 30,823 BTC and states buybacks become “most effective” when the stock trades below 1x mNAV, which is market capitalization divided by net asset value. Bitcoin treasury companies function as levered, flow-driven vehicles rather than simple proxies for spot Bitcoin. So, does recent outperformance reflect sustainable a business model or a momentum cycle that will fade when Bitcoin stalls or mNAV premium compresses? Leverage and buybacks drive equity convexity A Bitcoin-collateralized credit line used to repurchase shares increases per-share Bitcoin exposure and typically pushes the equity’s mNAV back toward or above 1x during rallies. The exact structure increases downside convexity if Bitcoin falls or the mNAV premium compresses, because debt remains fixed. At the same time, the collateral asset fluctuates, and share-count reductions magnify per-share volatility. Strategy has deployed convertible debt and at-the-market equity programs across multiple cycles, delivering equity outperformance during Bitcoin rallies and sharp underperformance during drawdowns. Semler Scientific funded treasury growth through ATM issuance and later transactions, exhibiting a flow-driven behavior in which equity returns diverge from spot Bitcoin returns during premium cycles and capital-structure moves. Recent performance illustrates that dispersion. Over the past 30 days, Strategy’s stock declined roughly 13%, Metaplanet’s US over-the-counter listing fell approximately 10%, and Semler Scientific gained about 7.5% following deal announcements. Those moves were driven as much by mNAV swings and equity flows as by Bitcoin’s relatively flat price action. The pattern fits a momentum model in which equity performance depends on premium expansion or contraction, issuance or buyback timing, and market appetite for levered Bitcoin exposure, rather than Bitcoin price alone. Institutional lenders typically require low starting loan-to-value ratios and maintenance triggers for Bitcoin-collateralized credit. Strategy’s 2022 Silvergate loan involved roughly $820 million in Bitcoin collateral for a $205 million draw, representing approximately 25% LTV and illustrating the over-collateralization standard that forces rapid deleveraging during sharp Bitcoin declines. Metaplanet’s filings do not disclose specific LTV terms or collateral triggers, leaving open the question of how much cushion the company maintains and whether drawdowns could trigger margin calls or forced asset sales. Mechanics that amplify cycles The math behind treasury-stock convexity combines four multipliers: Bitcoin’s price move, Bitcoin’s share of net asset value, changes in the mNAV multiple, and the inverse change in share count. When a company borrows against Bitcoin to buy back shares, net asset value becomes more sensitive to Bitcoin moves because debt is fixed while the collateral fluctuates. Simultaneously, share count falls and per-share Bitcoin exposure rises, often leading to mNAV re-rating, but that re-rating reverses violently during Bitcoin drawdowns when markets discount leverage risk and potential margin calls. Metaplanet’s filings explicitly acknowledge this dynamic by targeting buybacks when the stock trades below 1x mNAV. If Bitcoin remains flat and the stock trades at 0.95 to 1.00x mNAV, buybacks can close the discount and lift equity returns even if spot Bitcoin remains flat. If Bitcoin rallies 20% and mNAV expands to 1.1 or 1.2x, leverage combined with reduced share count typically delivers equity outperformance. If Bitcoin drops 20% and lenders demand collateral top-ups, the equity can underperform Bitcoin as mNAV sags and markets price in deleveraging risk. That pattern defines momentum amplification rather than a stable, Bitcoin-correlated investment. The use of proceeds, such as Bitcoin purchases, buybacks, or funding the company’s Bitcoin income business, adds another layer of discretion. Issuing equity during strength to buy Bitcoin and repurchasing shares during weakness creates per-share Bitcoin growth over time, but leaves the company exposed to cycle risk when premium and discount regimes flip. Treasury companies that execute this playbook effectively can compound per-share Bitcoin exposure. Those that mistime issuance or face forced deleveraging during drawdowns destroy value relative to holding Bitcoin directly. Regulatory and governance context Japanese corporate law allows boards to authorize buybacks if the company’s articles so provide, under Companies Act Article 165, the authority Metaplanet cites in its disclosure. No shareholder vote was required for the buyback program itself, though significant capital-structure changes, including charter amendments and major equity offerings, went to shareholders during 2025. Coverage of Metaplanet’s recent shareholder meetings indicates that investors approved substantial capital raises earlier this year to fund the Bitcoin strategy. Listing-rule frameworks differ across markets. The UK Financial Conduct Authority’s July 2024 overhaul removed most shareholder-vote requirements for significant transactions, shifting to a disclosure model and reducing friction for significant capital moves. Hong Kong still requires shareholder approval and a circular for Very Substantial Acquisitions under Chapter 14 of the listing rules, maintaining process-heavy governance for companies pivoting to treasury strategies. There is no new, universal regulation forcing votes on Bitcoin treasury shifts. Instead, normal listing and corporate rules apply with varying levels of shareholder gating depending on jurisdiction. Testing the momentum hypothesis Treasury stocks function as momentum amplifiers when their returns depend more on mNAV premium cycles and capital flows than on Bitcoin’s spot price. Evidence supporting that characterization includes the performance dispersion across Strategy, Metaplanet, and Semler Scientific despite similar Bitcoin exposure. The companies’ explicit strategies of issuing into strength and buying back into weakness, and the structural leverage that magnifies both upside and downside relative to Bitcoin. The alternative view, that treasury stocks represent durable business models with sustainable outperformance, requires demonstrating that per-share Bitcoin growth and operational cash flows justify persistent mNAV premia above 1x. To date, most treasury companies trade at varying premia or discounts based on market sentiment, Bitcoin momentum, and capital-structure announcements rather than on fundamental cash flow generation. Strategy’s software business contributes modest revenue relative to its Bitcoin holdings. Metaplanet’s operational businesses remain minor relative to its treasury. Semler Scientific generates medical device revenue but frames its equity story around Bitcoin exposure. The key variables to track include facility drawdowns and their timing, disclosed collateral terms and LTV triggers, and the company’s mNAV relative to 1x over time. Suppose Metaplanet draws the full $500 million to repurchase shares during periods when the stock trades below 1x mNAV and Bitcoin remains flat or rising. In that case, the strategy can deliver equity outperformance by closing the discount and increasing per-share Bitcoin. If the company draws during a Bitcoin rally when mNAV already exceeds 1×, it amplifies upside exposure but also magnifies downside risk if Bitcoin subsequently corrects and lenders tighten collateral requirements. Historical precedent suggests that Bitcoin-collateralized credit introduces margin-call risk during fast drawdowns. Lenders commonly require conservative LTVs and over-collateralization, meaning companies must maintain excess collateral or face forced deleveraging, the signature characteristic of a momentum amplifier rather than a defensive treasury. Metaplanet’s filings state that proceeds may fund buybacks, additional Bitcoin purchases, or the company’s Bitcoin income business, but do not specify collateral management protocols or LTV maintenance covenants. What defines durable versus cyclical models A treasury stock stops functioning as a momentum vehicle when Bitcoin declines, the mNAV premium compresses, and debt LTV constraints tighten simultaneously, forcing equity to underperform spot Bitcoin. The same stock can generate positive returns even when Bitcoin is flat if buybacks close an mNAV discount to 1x. During Bitcoin rallies with expanding premia, the equity typically outperforms through leverage, reduced share count, and multiple expansion. The momentum flywheel turns at full speed. Corporate Bitcoin finance now includes convertible debt, Bitcoin-secured credit, ATM equity programs, preferred shares, and warrants. The differentiator over time is the cost of capital and collateral terms rather than headline Bitcoin exposure. Companies that access low-cost financing and maintain conservative LTVs can weather drawdowns without forced selling. Those operating at tight LTV margins or high borrowing costs face greater cycle risk. Listing-rule evolution also matters. The UK’s reform reduces vote friction for large transactions, potentially enabling more aggressive capital cycling. Hong Kong’s continued requirement for shareholder approval on big moves provides a gating mechanism that could dampen momentum cycles. If additional treasury companies list or relist in jurisdictions with lighter governance requirements, flow-driven strategies could become more pronounced with fewer structural checks. Metaplanet’s Oct. 28 disclosure positions the company as executing a mature treasury playbook, using Bitcoin as collateral to manage equity valuation through buybacks while maintaining flexibility to deploy capital across purchases, repurchases, or operations. The effectiveness of that strategy depends on execution timing, collateral management, and whether the mNAV premium persists or compresses. The one-year authorization window through Oct. 28, 2026, will test whether Bitcoin treasury stocks represent a new asset class with durable premia or momentum trades that fade when underlying cycles turn.

        "content": "A file image of UPPL president Pramod Boro and Assam CM Sarma at NDA workers meet on September 18, 2024 (Photo: Pramod Boro/meta)Bijni, Oct 29: Amid growing speculation over a possible exit of the United People’s Party Liberal (UPPL) from the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) following its defeat in the recent BTC polls, the party on Wednesday clarified that a final decision will be taken at its upcoming conference in November.Addressing reporters, former BTC Executive Member and UPPL councillor from Manas Serfang constituency, Dhananjay Basumatary, said that while several district leaders proposed quitting the NDA during a meeting, the party has yet to take a call on the matter. “Yesterday, a meeting was held with UPPL members at Gabbru Khunda Manas Resort. Some members suggested that the UPPL should exit the NDA soon, but the party decided to review the issue again in the November conference,” Basumatary said. He added that the Tuesday meeting, attended by UPPL president Pramod Boro and other senior leaders, focused on identifying shortcomings in the party’s electoral strategy and performance. “Since the people of BTR have given their mandate to the BPF, the meeting was convened to analyse the reasons behind our defeat. We will also assess the response our cabinet minister, Urkhao Gwra Brahma, has received from the NDA government and evaluate what has been delivered to our MP before taking a final decision,” he said. In a gesture of political civility, Basumatary also extended his wishes to BPF chief Hagrama Mohilary, expressing hope that his government would work for the welfare of the people of the Bodoland Territorial Region. Basumatary, who recently won a second term in the 2025 BTC elections, maintained that the UPPL leadership remains united and committed to introspection before making any strategic decision about its alliance.",

Pi Network’s PI is in the opposite corner with a double-digit gain.BTC Slips Ahead of Fed’s DecisionThe primary cryptocurrency registered an impressive uptick on Monday (October 27), temporarily climbing above $116,000. It surpassed that level yesterday, too, but since then, BTC has been in an evident downtrend.Several hours ago, the price tumbled to approximately $112,300. The bulls managed to reclaim some lost ground, and as of this writing, Bitcoin is hovering around $113,000, representing a 1.2% decline on a daily scale.BTC Price, Source: TradingViewThe heightened volatility comes just hours before the FOMC meeting, during which the Federal Reserve will decide whether to raise, lower, or keep interest rates in the United States unchanged. The odds of a 0.25% drop are almost certain (according to bets on Polymarket), and we will see how the official announcement impacts the crypto sector. According to some analysts, Bitcoin is at a crossroads and its valuation could either shoot above $120,000 or collapse well below $100K.Lower interest rates are generally considered good news for bulls, as they could dampen investor appetite for traditional financial products and encourage investment in digital assets.Following BTC’s price retreat over the past 24 hours, its market capitalization has headed south to around $2.25 trillion, while its dominance over the altcoins stands at nearly 59%.PI Enters Green TerritoryEthereum (ETH) has followed BTC’s footsteps, plunging by 3% to under $4,000. Solana (SOL), Bittensor (TAO), Sui (SUI), Hedera (HBAR), and Ethena (ENA) are also among the biggest losers, with declines of 4-7%.Somewhat surprisingly, Pi Network’s native cryptocurrency is the best-performing digital asset (from the top 100 club) today, with its price spiking by 15% to $0.26. Other notable gainers include TRUMP (+13%) and M (+4%).The total cryptocurrency market capitalization has retraced by 1.7% in the last day to around $3.88 trillion.Cryptocurrency Market Overview, Source: QuantifyCrypto The post Bitcoin (BTC) Plunges Before the FOMC Meeting, Pi Network (PI) Soars by 15%: Market Watch appeared first on CryptoPotato.",

        "description": "Bitcoin price consolidates above $110,000 amid rising demand for BTC ETFs and other products, reflecting growing investor interest in Bitcoin and global cryptocurrencies.",
        "content": "Bitcoin price is trading around $113,000 after touching a record high near $126,000 in early October 2025. Strong inflows into Bitcoin ETFs and other ETFs boosted market momentum early in the month. A mid-October correction showed how leverage and low liquidity still drive Bitcoin volatility. During October 2025, Bitcoin price moved within a notably wide range. At the start of the month, it was trading in the low-to-mid six-figure region in US dollars. Then the price climbed to near $124,000–$126,000 before pulling back sharply in mid-October and recovering somewhat into the $112,000–$115,000 zone by late October. In this timeframe, the key support level near $105,000 was tested during the drop, while resistance formed around the $126,000 margin. Also Read: How Bitcoin Options Open Interest Can Boost Crypto Payroll Integration? What’s Driving the Market A number of factors combined to push Bitcoin’s price higher and then cause the correction. Expectations around the policy decisions of the Federal Reserve played an important role. Market participants largely priced in a rate cut, which tends to encourage more risk-taking investments like cryptocurrencies since lower yields on safe assets make risk assets more attractive. When signals came from central-bank communications suggesting easing might arrive, Bitcoin benefited; but when uncertainty or stronger-than-expected rate language surfaced, volatility increased. Another key driver has been the increasing presence of institutional-type investment in Bitcoin via exchange-traded funds (ETFs). In early October, global crypto ETFs pulled in nearly $6 billion in a single week, as demand for digital-asset exposure surged. Around October 5, Bitcoin reached a new all-time high near $125,689 , largely driven by favourable ETF flows and a weaker US dollar. At the same time, volume data suggest room for growth in participation: even as net inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs turned positive again near late October, daily flow rates remained below the peaks seen earlier in the cycle. The correction in mid-October highlighted important structural risks. According to noted data, futures-market open interest for Bitcoin had climbed to record heights earlier in the month, and when a sharp drawdown occurred, margin liquidations triggered cascading moves. This shows that in addition to the “buy” side, the selling pressures and derivatives mechanics can rapidly push price lower when sentiment shifts or liquidity withdraws. Technical and Fundamental Viewpoints From a technical standpoint, the chart reveals the wide trading band of roughly $105,000 to $126,000. If Bitcoin decisively breaks above the $124,000–$126,000 zone, it would open the door for further gains; conversely, a break below support near $105,000 could open the door to deeper corrective action. Bitcoin price prediction states that the ongoing institutional adoption of regulated products will remain positive for the medium-term narrative. The cryptocurrency’s interplay with macro factors is critical. With leverage high in the derivatives market and on-chain activity showing signs of accumulation, the environment remains favourable for upside, but only while confidence and liquidity hold. Key Risks and Upcoming Triggers Future policy surprises from the Fed or other major central banks are one of the biggest risks for BTC. Regulatory developments can impact Bitcoin ETF flows, and concentrated derivatives positions could trigger cascading unwinds. On the positive side, strong inflows into ETP products or renewed macro easing could serve as catalysts for another leg higher. Also Read : Bitcoin Isn’t an Inflation Hedge but Benefits When the Dollar Falters Outlook This month has been a reminder that while the upward momentum remains alive for Bitcoin, the path is far from smooth. Price action remains sensitive to policy, institutional flows, and market-structure dynamics. Within the current trading range of roughly $105,000 to $126,000, a sustained move above the upper range would renew bullish momentum , whereas a drop below support could shift sentiment toward a deeper correction. The broader adoption trend remains intact, but caution is warranted given the still-elevated leverage and liquidity risks.",

Ethereum Surge Fueled by Institutional Inflows Advertisement Banner Once seen as merely an “alternative play” to Bitcoin, Ethereum is now stepping confidently out of Bitcoin’s shadow. Recent fund data shows that Ethereum holdings have soared to approximately 6.8 million Ethereum, which is mostly due to spot ETF inflows, enticing staking yields, and the increasing dominance of Ethereum throughout DeFi and asset tokenization. Such institutional interest has brought additional momentum to the current Ethereum surge which has made it a dominant figure in the next crypto cycle. Bitcoin’s Momentum Slows Amid Ethereum Surge Conversely, Bitcoin still maintains its conventional purpose of a reserve asset of institutions, as there is a consistent though modest increase of 36% in the number of funds held of 1.3 million BTC. As the number of institutional funds entering Bitcoin grows, it is slower than all other indices and may signify a slowdown in momentum, but Ethereum’s explosion signifies that investors are more willing to embrace growth and innovation.

The market first indications suggest that the long awaited altcoin rotation is possible to be already in action.

However, such a narrow performance is typically followed by a wide-ranging recovery in risk appetite a traditional indication of early accumulation. Ethereum Expansion Fuels Institutional Altcoin Growth This period of accumulation, analysts believe, is the point where newer altcoins quietly bottom, creating the next step of the rotation. Some of the tokens like Synthetix (SNX) and Binance Coin (BNB) have already started recording an increase in relative returns, which indicated that early-cycle measures are strengthening, in part with the broader Ethereum surge throughout institutional portfolios. This trend is also supported by historical data. A long-term comparative chart of the altcoins versus Bitcoin reveals that altcoin booms have traditionally followed Bitcoin booms, in both the 2017 and 2021 cycles. This keeps me awake at night If this trend line extends into 2025/6 we should see the biggest alt season of all time While some believe altcoins will never compete with Bitcoin again I see potential for the biggest liquidity rotation of all time pic.twitter.com/Rqe3XzHmxG — EllioTrades (@elliotrades) October 27, 2025 Ranging into 2025, technical charts are once again showing a multi-year wedge breakout in various altcoins a pattern that has heretofore occurred before massive rallies. Should this trend continue to be true, the next market turn may already be shaping up, and the Ethereum surge may be at the forefront and reestablishing the balance of power in the worldwide crypto market.
