      "description": "Messages in a bottle written by two Australian soldiers a few days into their voyage to the battlefields of France during World War I have been found more than a century later on Australia's coast.The Brown family found the Schweppes-brand bottle just above the waterline at Wharton Beach near Esperance in Western Australia state on Oct. 9, Deb Brown said on Tuesday.Her husband Peter and daughter Felicity made the find during one of the family's regular quad bike expeditions to clear the beach of trash.\"We do a lot of cleaning up on our beaches and so would never go past a piece of rubbish. So this little bottle was lying there waiting to be picked up,\" Deb Brown said.Inside the clear, thick glass were cheerful letters written in pencil by Privates Malcolm Neville, 27, and William Harley, 37, dated Aug. 15, 1916.Their troop ship HMAT A70 Ballarat had left the South Australia state capital Adelaide to the east on Aug. 12 of that year on the long journey to the other side of the world where its soldiers would reinforce the 48th Australian Infantry Battalion on Europe's Western Front.Neville was killed in action a year later. Harley was wounded twice but survived the war, dying in Adelaide in 1934 of a cancer his family say was caused by him being gassed by the Germans in the trenches.Neville requested the bottle's finder deliver his letter to his mother Robertina Neville at Wilkawatt, now a virtual ghost town in South Australia. Harley, whose mother was dead by 1916, was happy for the finder to keep his note.Harley wrote \"may the finder be as well as we are at present.\"Neville wrote to his mother he was \"having a real good time, food is real good so far, with the exception of one meal which we buried at sea.\"The ship was \"heaving and rolling, but we are as happy as Larry,\" Neville wrote, using a now faded Australian colloquialism meaning very happy.Neville wrote that he and his comrades were, \"Somewhere at Sea.\" Harley wrote that they were, \"Somewhere in the Bight,\" referring to the Great Australian Bight. That's an enormous open bay that begins east of Adelaide and extends to Esperance on the western edge.Deb Brown suspects the bottle didn't travel far. It likely spent more than a century ashore buried in the sand dunes. Extensive erosion of the dunes caused by huge swells along Wharton Beach in recent months probably dislodged it.The paper was wet, but the writing remained legible. Because of that, Deb Brown was able to notify both soldiers' relatives of the find.The bottle \"is in pristine condition. It doesn't have any growth of any barnacles on it. I believe that if it had been at sea or if it had been exposed for that long, the paper would've disintegrated from the sun. We wouldn't have been able to read it,\" she said.Harley's granddaughter Ann Turner said her family was \"absolutely stunned\" by the find.\"We just can't believe it. It really does feel like a miracle and we do very much feel like our grandfather has reached out for us from the grave,\" Turner told Australian Broadcasting Corp.Neville's great nephew Herbie Neville said his family had been brought together by the \"unbelievable\" discovery.\"It sounds as though he was pretty happy to go to the war. It's just so sad what happened. It's so sad that he lost is life,\" Herbie Neville said.\"Wow. What a man he was,\" the great nephew added with pride.",

      "description": "Chennai police have arrested a 22-year-old bike-taxi driver for allegedly raping a woman passenger from Tripura after threatening her during a ride. The accused, identified as Sivakumar from Theni district, was taken into custody by the T-5 Vanagaram Police following a complaint filed by the survivor.According to the complaint, the woman, who lives in Maduravoyal with her husband, had booked a ride through a vehicle aggregator app on Sunday night to travel to Pallikaranai, as per a report on NDTV. However, during the return trip early Tuesday morning, Sivakumar allegedly diverted to a secluded stretch, threatened to kill her, and sexually assaulted her before dropping her at her residence. The woman informed her husband about the incident, after which they approached the police.Bike-Taxi Driver Arrested For Raping Of WomanInvestigators found the complaint to be credible and swiftly registered a case. Sivakumar was arrested, produced before a magistrate, and remanded to judicial custody. Police said the woman’s husband confronted the accused before handing him over to authorities.Meanwhile, the incident has reignited public concern over women’s safety in Chennai. Earlier, opposition parties criticised the state government for failing to curb rising sexual offences. However, state police officials maintained that strict measures are being implemented and trials in such cases are being expedited to ensure swift justice.This case follows a similar incident reported last month, when a 19-year-old college student was arrested for allegedly harassing a female bike-taxi rider while travelling as a pillion passenger. The recurring cases have triggered fresh calls for ride-hailing platforms to enforce stricter background checks, safety monitoring, and accountability mechanisms for their drivers.ALSO READ: Cyclone Montha Weakens After Landfall In Andhra Pradesh, Says IMD; Heavy Rain Batters Coastal Districts",
