            "description": "India and China held the 23rd round of Corps Commander Level talks at the Chushul-Moldo border meeting point on 25 October 2025, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said on Sunday. This discussion marked the first General-Level engagement in the Western Sector since the 24th round of Special Representatives’ talks held in August this year.According to the MEA, the talks were conducted in a “friendly and cordial atmosphere,” reflecting a continued effort by both sides to sustain dialogue over outstanding issues along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).Progress and Stability ReviewedThe two sides took note of the progress made since the 22nd round of Corps Commander Level talks held in October 2024. They also shared the view that peace and tranquillity have been maintained in the border areas, a key objective amid ongoing disengagement efforts following tensions that began in 2020.Commitment to Existing MechanismsBoth delegations agreed to continue making use of existing diplomatic and military communication channels to address any issues that arise on the ground. The MEA said this approach remains vital for ensuring stability and preventing escalation in sensitive frontier zones.The talks underline the sustained engagement between New Delhi and Beijing to restore normalcy along the LAC. While some friction points remain unresolved, both countries reiterated their intention to maintain peace and stability through dialogue and established mechanisms.",
